      "today, you made an angle measuring tool using tracing paper. This tool helped us\n",
      "measure angles.  Trigonometry is actually the study of triangles, especially\n",
      "right triangles (triangles with one 90-degree angle). It involves understanding\n",
      "the relationships between the sides and angles of these triangles.  Think of it\n",
      "like this: imagine you have a triangle with two shorter sides (called legs) and\n",
      "a longer side opposite one of the angles. Trigonometry helps us figure out the\n",
      "length of that long side, or other unknowns in the triangle, using the known\n",
      "angles and side lengths.  In your angle measuring tool, when you placed the\n",
      "straw at the center and measured turns with respect to the starting point, you\n",
      "were actually getting a sense of the relationships between the angles and sides\n",
      "of the triangle. That's basically what trigonometry is all about!  Does that\n",

      "sides (let's call them \"AB\" and \"BC\") and a longer side opposite one of the\n",
      "angles (let's say angle C). This is a basic representation of a right triangle.\n",
